“When you take a job in the Premier League you are going to to have to understand you are going to have these days,” he said.

“I understand there will be emotion around it for me and my family. I tried to focus on Aston Villa and make sure that was the priority.

“I was very respectful and thankful for the reception I got, which was only natural because of the years of my life I gave to this club.”

Gerrard selected a defence-minded starting line-up with creative midfielder Emiliano Buendia and former Liverpool forward Danny Ings both on the bench.

Villa had frustrated the Reds until the goal, with Buendia and Ings then introduced as the visitors pressed hard for an equaliser.

And explaining his team’s approach, Gerrard said: “We tried to get the balance right and I thought we did a good job of trying to contain Liverpool, you can try to be too gung-ho and get hit for a scoreline which doesn't help.
