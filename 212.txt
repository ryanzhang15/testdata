Steven Gerrard has expressed gratitude for the reception he received from Liverpool supporters on his return to Anfield – as he outlined the plan that nearly thwarted his former side.

Mohamed Salah’s 67th-minute penalty was the difference as the Reds eked out a 1-0 win over Gerrard’s Aston Villa on Saturday.

It was the first time the Liverpool legend had been in the opposing dugout as a manager, and he was given a warm welcome before the game by home fans who also sang his name briefly in the eighth minute.

And while keen to emphasise his focus was on Villa, Gerrard admits it was an emotional afternoon.
