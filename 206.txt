Ronaldo sends defiant message
Match-winner Cristiano Ronaldo has said that United have taken another step in the 'right direction' following their 1-0 triumph over Norwich City at Carrow Road.

The Portugal international scored the only goal of the game, converting a 75th-minute penalty, to seal a third successive Premier League victory, as well as a second in as many league outings under new interim manager Ralf Rangnick.

Ronaldo was hauled down inside the penalty area by Canaries right-back Max Aarons and smashed the ball home from 12 yards, sending goalkeeper Tim Krul the wrong way.

United had to dig deep for the victory, with Norwich having no shortage of chances to take at least a point.
