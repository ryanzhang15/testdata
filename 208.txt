Verstappen and Hamilton are level on points going into the final race of the season, but Verstappen has the advantage in the standings by virtue of the amount of race wins he's recorded (nine, to Hamilton's eight), and it had been speculated that the Dutchman could attempt to take the seven-time world champion out of the race in a bid to win the world title by default.

But Hamilton has received support in the form of Masi, who has warned race officials can still hand out points penalties for any under-handed tactics.

"I can’t control the actions of the two individuals, only they can," he said.

“But within the regulations we have penalties, be it time or grid penalties. In addition, the International Sporting Code has provision for the stewards to disqualify a competitor or dock championship points.

"So, yes, Max could be deducted points, as could any team. We hope it isn’t necessary, but it is one of the tools available. I will remind all the teams and drivers of these provisions."
