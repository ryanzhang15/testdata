Max Verstappen believes he is treated unfairly and joked FIA bosses have been using the money from his fines for their leisure.

In last week’s chaotic Saudi Arabian GP, the Dutchman was hit with two penalties, one for gaining an advantage after leaving the track and one for "erratic" braking, causing title rival Lewis Hamilton to plough into the back of him.

The 24-year-old was slapped with a 10-second penalty at the end of the race, but it did not impact his second-place finish.

At the previous race in Qatar, Verstappen was slapped with a five-place grid penalty after ignoring yellow flags during qualifying and was investigated for an incident with Lewis Hamilton, 36, at the Sao Paulo GP.
