Manchester United beat Norwich 1-0 in the Premer League on Saturday evening.

Ralf Rangnick was appointed as Ole Gunnar Solskjaer's interim successor last week and the German won his first game in charge 1-0 against Crystal Palace on Sunday. However, United could only draw 1-1 with BSC Young Boys on Wednesday night.

But United secured another three points and yet another clean sheet in the league with their win over Norwich, despite an unconvincing display.

The Reds looked poor in the final third and devoid of quality throughout most of the game, but Cristiano Ronaldo was brought down in the second half for a penalty — and the forward duly obliged when smashing home into the left corner past Tim Krul.

Rangnick confirmed that 'everything seems ok' with Victor Lindelof after he left the pitch in some discomfort.
