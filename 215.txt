Jeff Bezos on Saturday night said he was “heartbroken” over the deaths of at least six Amazon employees in an Illinois warehouse hit by a tornado Friday.

The Amazon founder was blasted on social media earlier Saturday for failing to mention the deadly incident in Edwardsville while cheering on his latest group of space tourists in an Instagram post.

“The news from Edwardsville is tragic,” he finally said in a statement on Twitter at around 9 p.m. “We’re heartbroken over the loss of our teammates there, and our thoughts and prayers are with their families and loved ones.”

“All of Edwardsville should know that the Amazon team is committed to supporting them and will be by their side through this crisis,” the post continued. “We extend our fullest gratitude to all the incredible first responders who have worked so tirelessly at the site.”

The statement came 24 hours after the tornado struck, and after Bezos had posted a photo on Instagram with the latest crew of his New Shepard rocket, including former NFL champion Michael Strahan.
