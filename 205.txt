Amad set for loan move - reports
United youngster Amad is poised to leave the club on loan during next month's transfer window - a report by Italian journalist Fabrizio Romano as cited by the The Mail claims.

The former Atalanta man, who started United's 1-1 draw with Young Boys in the Champions League on Wednesday night, has been closely linked with an array of big-name European clubs in recent weeks, as he looks to step-up his prospects of securing more regular first-team football.

The Ivory Coast international was close to leaving United at the end of the summer transfer window, but his temporary switch to Feyenoord collapsed as a result of him picking up an injury.

Nevertheless, the youngster has continued to attract plenty of interest and is said to be 'excited' about the prospect of heading out on loan. Feyenoord have retained their interest in his services.
