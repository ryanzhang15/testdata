DDG tells United where to improve
David de Gea produced several fine saves during the 1-0 victory over rock-bottom Norwich City.

It was Cristiano Ronaldo who settled the scores from the penalty spot - but at the other end the Spanish goalkeeper played an equally important role.

Here is what de Gea said during his post-match interview;

It was a great game, the rain was like proper English football. It's a massive win. Norwich improved a lot since the new manager came, so it was a tough game for sure, especially the last 15-20 minutes. We gave the ball away too easy, too quickly, so we need to improve on that, but in the first half we controlled the game, we had the ball, we created chances.
